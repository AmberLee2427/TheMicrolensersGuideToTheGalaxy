<!-- EXERCISE: BinarySourceE6.txt -->
Depnding on the priors you chose and the random errors you generated, you may find 
that u02, tE2, or both are very poorly contrained; this would look like a large spread
in the chains for those parameters. You could consider a prior that links the tE values
to something similar to each other. But we may also decide to apply a prior constraint
on the blend flux, which we reasonable know should not be negative for simulated data.
