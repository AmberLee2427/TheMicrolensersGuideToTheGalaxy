    "Microlensing is a fine-grain tool compared to large-scale lensing, and finding specific kinds of events takes a concerted effort, with tailored observing and data processing strategies. Microlensing surveys are oriented toward the bulge because it provides densely populated images, increasing the chance of transient alignment events, and the distance scales are compatible with the detection of lenses with masses ranging from planetary to stellar. For example, if we wanted to search for black holes on a much shorter time frame, with event timescales on the order of days to months, we would want to look for these objects at lens and source distance more like $1000\\,\\rm{kpc}$, which is to say in other galaxies in the local group, introducing a plethora of new observing challenges. Therefore, observing dark matter with microlensing requires some knowledge or theories about what it is.\n",

    "### Why do we need it?\n",
    "Dark matter is necessary to explain the collapse of the fairly homogeneous gas of the early universe, to progressively bigger clumps. This homogeneity is demonstrated by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which has density variations on the order of $10^{-5}$ [(Plank Collaboration, 2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&A...594A...1P). For the majority of its first $\\sim300\\,000$ years, the universe was a big photon-baryon soup. In the very early universe, quantum fluctuations created potential hills and wells, which were stretched onto cosmic scales during the rapid expansion period. These potential wells drew in material, but photon pressure in the baryon-photon fluid resisted this compression, resulting in oscillations. These oscillating pressure waves are known as baryonic acoustic oscillations and are responsible for the density landscape of the current universe; when the universe had cooled enough for atoms to form ([recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology))), the baryon-photon fluid released photons (first light, now observed as the CMB) and the pressure waves froze as they were. Dark matter acted to deepen the potential wells (gravitationally attracting material, but without the photon pressure forcing it to oscillate), which affected the acoustic oscillations. The specific manner in which the oscillations are predicted to be affected is supported by observed temperature variations in the CMB [Hu, 2000](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000Natur.404..939H).\n",
    "\n",
    "> <i>These effects and processes are well explained in [Wayne Hu's Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html). </i>\n",

    "<h5> <i>\"Diffusion damping during recombination is expected to wipe out all small-scale structure in baryons, preventing the formation of galaxies at late times. Dark matter, however, can sustain structure during the damping regime, and will seed the formation of galaxies\" </i> <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PhR...513....1C\"> - Clifton et al. (2020)</a> </h5>\n",

    "Dark matter is also used to explain the rotation curves we see in galaxies ([Linbald, 1927](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1927MNRAS..87..553L); [Babcock, 1939](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1939LicOB..19...41B); and [Oort, 1940](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1940ApJ....91..273O)). The expectation, from the density of luminous matter in galaxies, is for decreasing rotational velocity with radius (beyond the solid body rotation at the centre). However, observations of galaxies and clusters have consistently flat rotation curves ([Rubin & Ford, 1970](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970ApJ...159..379R)). Our current understanding of dark matter's role in Galactic structure is that it exists in a roughly spherical \"halo\" ([Navarro, Frenk, & White, 1996](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...462..563N); see also, [**NFW Profile**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile)), while the normal, radiative, star-forming gas collapses into a disk. This explains the flat rotation curves that we observe in galaxies because the mass is not concentrated in the Galactic centre. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dark matter is also necessary to explain the velocity dispersions we see in galaxy clusters ([Zwicky, 1933](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009GReGr..41..207Z)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dark matter is not a necessary part of the standard model of particle physics and cannot be described without extension to the standard model. Dark matter is entirely superfluous given our current understanding of particle physics. The existence of dark matter is entirely supported by astrophysical observations that do not match our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is it?\n",
    "There have been many proposed particle-physics solutions put forward to solve this astrophysical problem. Dark matter has been proposed in the form of exotic particles, such as [WIMPs (Weakly interacting massive particles)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle), [axions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion), and [sterile neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino). However, searches for these exotic particles have been largely fruitless (see, for example, the following review articles: [Peter, 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1201.3942P); [Profumo, Giani, & Piattella, 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Univ....5..213P)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another proposed solution to the dark matter problems is modified Newtonian dynamics ([MOND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics); [Milgrom, 1983](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...270..365M)), which postulates that this issue with rotation curves is not with our understanding of the composition of galaxies, but instead with our understanding of gravity at large distances. MOND described the gravitational force, beyond some acceleration limit, $a_0$, to be decreasing proportional to inverse radius as opposed to the inverse square radius of Newtonian dynamics. The theories developed to marry MOND with general relativity are collectively termed modified gravity (summarised in [Clifton et al., 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PhR...513....1C)). Arguments against modified gravity basically reduce to their mathematical formulations being phenomenological. Conversely, an oversimplification of arguments against general relativity being complete, and particle dark matter necessary, are the density model inconsistencies from cosmological to galactic scales (i.e., the cusp/core problem; [Del Popolo & Le Delliou, 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220914151D))."

The bonus to this interpretation is that one does not have to solve all of the problems that indicate the existence of dark matter at once because they are born of different models.  For example, MACHOs could explain the problem with the rotation curves of galaxies, but have no bearing on baryonic acoustic oscillations in the early universe.\n",

    "If MACHOs are responsible for the rotation curve of our galaxy, then source stars in the [Magellanic clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds) (the small Magellanic cloud (SMC) and large Magellanic cloud (LMC) dwarf galaxies orbiting the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way)).

The early microlensing surveys concentrated on SMC and LMC pointings because the number of stars in the SMC and LMC brought the probability of lensing events occurring up to reasonable levels, the line of sight is dominated by ``halo'' space, and the range of possible lens and source distances allowed for a large range of mass sensitivities ($10^{-7}\\,M_\\odot$ to $100\\,M_\\odot$; [Griest, 1991](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...366..412G)). They also recognised early on the benefits of bulge-directed observations, for their higher predicted event rate, for finding disk dark matter and probing the low-mass end of the stellar mass function ([Paczynski, 1991](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...371L..63P), [Griest et al., 1991](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...372L..79G)). \n",

But, suffice it to say that the number of halo lensing events did not meet the expectations set by a MACHO-dark-mater model. This is summarised in the findings of [Mroz et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240302398M);  in 20 years, there have been 13 event detections facing the LMC, all of which could plausibly be explained by disk or LMC lens stars.
