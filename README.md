## Introduction
Picture this: a galaxy brimming with mysteries and hoards of juicy Roman data waiting to unravel them. But this picture is missing something: a doe-eyed microlenser, whose fortitude and cleverness are up to the task of its unraveling—someone like you.

The goal of this project is to create an all-encompassing collection of Jupyter notebooks—your trusty companions for engaging exercises related to microlensing. Through these notebooks, the insights and experiences of microlensing elders can light your path as you embark on your journey of discovery and exploration through scientific research.

This guide follows a choose-your-own-adventure style. You control the specializations and knowledge you wish to become equipped with. That way, whether you are the min-maxing kind or more the type to vibe it out, this course is designed specifically for you.

These resources are made to be as freely available as HST time is not, beckoning anyone with a curious spirit to delve into the fascinating world of microlensing and contribute to its exciting development.

## Installation
To embark on your microlensing adventure, simply follow these straightforward steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmberLee2427/TheMicrolensersGuideToTheGalaxy.git
   ```
1. Create a dedicated environments with the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv
    python3 -m venv .*environment-name*
    source *environment-name*/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    for pip users on macOS or Linux,

    or

    ```bash
    conda env create --file=environment.yml
    conda activate TheGuide
    ```
    for Anaconda users. You can use the yaml specific to your operating system for a more stable notebook experience.
    
    Alternatively, without using environments (not recommended), you can install the required dependencies as follows:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    for pip users,

    or 

    ```bash
    conda install --file requirements.txt
    ```
    for Anaconda users. Installs using the requirements file are untested

And voilà! You’re ready to launch into the universe of data and discovery.

If however, this installation process leaves you as maniacally depressed as the adroid, Marvin, save yourself some heartache and refer to the expertise of your institutions designated tech expert. If you continue to experience faliures to launch, contact the project author. 

Some of the more specialised notebooks in this guide have further install requirements that we recommend you tackle on an as-needed basis.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks nestled within the `Notebooks` directory, where each document brims with exercises and illuminating examples. Follow the instructions inside your [`Introduction.ipynb`](https://github.com/AmberLee2427/TheMicrolensersGuideToTheGalaxy/blob/main/Notebooks/Introduction.ipynb) notebook and prepare to explore the captivating concepts of microlensing with all the enthusiasm of a seasoned hitchhiker.
